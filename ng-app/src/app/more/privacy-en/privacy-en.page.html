    <p><strong>Relevant legal bases</strong></p>



    <p>In the following section, we provide the legal basis of the basic data protection regulation (DSGVO), on the
      basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of the DSGVO, national
      data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence and domicile.</p>



    <ol>
      <li>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a DSGVO) – The data subject has given his or her consent to the
        processing of personal data relating to him or her for one or more specific purposes.</li>
      <li>Fulfilment of a contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b. FADP) – Processing
        is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the implementation of
        pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject.</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. FADP) – Processing is necessary to safeguard the
        legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party unless the interests or fundamental rights and
        freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data prevail.</li>
    </ol>



    <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany</strong></p>



    <p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the basic data protection regulation, national regulations on
      data protection apply in Germany. These include in particular the law on protection against misuse of personal
      data in data processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations
      on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right of objection, the processing of special categories
      of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision making in
      individual cases including profiling.</p>



    <p>Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in
      particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the
      consent of employees. Additionally, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>



    <p><strong>Security measures</strong></p>



    <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into
      account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the
      processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk.</p>



    <p>Those measures shall include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data
      by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, safeguarding
      of availability and segregation of data relating to them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure
      that data subjects’ rights are exercised, data is deleted and responses to data threats are made. Furthermore, we
      take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software
      and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, by designing technology and by using data
      protection-friendly default settings.</p>



    <p><strong>SSL encryption (https):</strong></p>



    <p>To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted
      connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.</p>



    <p><strong>Transmission and disclosure of personal data</strong></p>



    <p>Within the scope of our processing of personal data, it happens that the data is transferred to other bodies,
      companies, legally independent organisational units or persons or that it is disclosed to them. The recipients of
      this data may include, for example, payment institutions in the context of payment transactions, service providers
      commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases
      we observe the legal requirements and in particular conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the
      recipients of your data which serve to protect your data.</p>



    <p><strong>Data processing in third countries</strong></p>



    <p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or
      if the processing takes place in the context of the use of services provided by third parties or the disclosure or
      transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is only done in accordance with the legal
      requirements.</p>



    <p>Subject to express consent or to contractual or legally required transfers, we process or allow the data to be
      processed only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, including the US processors
      certified under the Privacy Shield, or on the basis of special guarantees, such as contractual obligations under
      so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, the existence of certifications or binding internal
      data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission:
      https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de ).</p>



    <p><strong>Use of cookies</strong></p>



    <p>Cookies are text files that contain data from websites or domains visited and are stored by a browser on the
      user’s computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after his visit within an
      online offer. The stored information may include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login
      status, a shopping cart or the location where a video was viewed. The term “cookies” also includes other
      technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user information is stored using pseudonymous
      online identifiers, also known as “user IDs”).</p>



    <p>The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:</p>



    <ol>
      <li><strong>Temporary cookies</strong> (also: session or session cookies): Temporary cookies are deleted at the
        latest after a user leaves an online offer and closes his browser.</li>
      <li><strong>Permanent cookies</strong>: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For
        example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a
        website again. The interests of users used for reach measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in
        such a cookie.</li>
      <li><strong>First-party cookies</strong>: First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Third party cookies</strong>: Third party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third
        parties) to process user information.</li>
      <li><strong>Necessary</strong> (also: essential or imperative) cookies: Cookies can be absolutely necessary for
        the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).</li>
      <li><strong>Statistical, marketing and personalization cookies</strong>: Furthermore, cookies are usually also
        used in the context of range measurement as well as when the interests of a user or his or her behavior (e.g.
        viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) on individual web pages are stored in a user profile. Such
        profiles are used to show users e.g. content that corresponds to their potential interests. This procedure is
        also known as “tracking”, i.e., following the potential interests of users. . If we use cookies or “tracking”
        technologies, we will inform you separately in our data protection declaration or when obtaining your consent.
      </li>
    </ol>



    <p><strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong></p>



    <p>The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask you for
      your consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data
      is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the aid of cookies will be processed on the basis of
      our legitimate interests (e.g. in the business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use
      of cookies is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations.</p>



    <p><strong>General notes on revocation and objection (opt-out):</strong></p>



    <p>Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the possibility at any time
      to revoke a given consent or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively
      referred to as “opt-out”). You can initially declare your objection by means of the settings of your browser, e.g.
      by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online service).</p>



    <p>An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of
      services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites http://optout.aboutads.info and
      http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. In addition, you can receive further notices of objection in the context of the
      information on the service providers and cookies used.</p>



    <p><strong>Processing of cookie data based on consent:&nbsp;</strong></p>



    <p>Before we process data within the scope of the use of cookies or have them processed, we ask users for their
      consent, which can be revoked at any time. Before consent has not been given, cookies are used if necessary, which
      are necessary for the operation of our online offer. Their use is based on our interest and the interest of the
      users in the expected functionality of our online offer.</p>



    <ol>
      <li><strong>Processed types of data</strong>: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access
        times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
      <li><strong>Persons concerned</strong>: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6
        para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ol>



    <p><strong>Performance of tasks in accordance with the articles of association or rules of procedure</strong></p>



    <p>We process the data of our members, supporters, interested parties, business partners or other persons
      (collectively “data subjects”), if we have a membership or other business relationship with them and perform our
      duties and are recipients of services and benefits. In all other respects, we process the data of Data Subjects on
      the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g. if administrative tasks or public relations work are involved.</p>



    <p>The data processed, the type, scope and purpose of such processing and the necessity of processing them are
      determined by the underlying membership or contractual relationship, from which the necessity of any data
      information also arises (in other respects we refer to required data).</p>



    <p>We delete data that is no longer necessary for the provision of our statutory and business purposes. This is
      determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. We retain the data for as long as they
      may be relevant to the processing of the business and also with regard to any warranty or liability obligations
      based on our legitimate interest in their regulation. The necessity of storing the data is regularly reviewed;
      otherwise the statutory storage obligations apply.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processed data types:</strong> inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), payment data (e.g. bank
        details, invoices, payment history), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), contract data (e.g. subject
        matter of the contract, duration, customer category).</li>
      <li><strong>Persons concerned</strong>: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services), members, business
        and contractual partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing</strong>: contractual services and performance, contact requests and
        communication, administration and answering of requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Fulfilment of contracts and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
        b. DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ul>



    <p><strong>Payment service provider</strong></p>



    <p>Within the framework of contractual and other legal relationships, due to legal obligations or otherwise based on
      our legitimate interests, we offer the persons concerned efficient and secure payment options and use other
      payment service providers in addition to banks and credit institutions (collectively “payment service providers”).
    </p>



    <p>The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, such as name and address, bank data,
      such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as contract, sum and
      recipient related data. These details are required to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is
      only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. This means that we do not receive any account
      or credit card-related information, but only information with confirmation or negative information about the
      payment. Under certain circumstances, the payment service providers may transmit the data to credit agencies. The
      purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. In this regard, we refer to the General
      Terms and Conditions and the data protection notices of the payment service providers.</p>



    <p>The terms and conditions and the data protection information of the respective payment service providers apply to
      the payment transactions, which can be called up within the respective websites or transaction applications. We
      also refer to these for further information and the assertion of rights of revocation, information and other
      rights of affected persons.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processed data types</strong>: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), payment data (e.g. bank
        details, invoices, and payment history), contract data (e.g. subject matter of the contract, duration, and
        customer category), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication
        data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
      <li><strong>Affected persons</strong>: Customers, interested parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing</strong>: contractual services and performance, contact requests and
        communication, affiliate tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Fulfilment of contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1
        lit. b. DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ul>

    </ol>



    <p><strong>Blogs and publication media</strong></p>



    <p>We use blogs or comparable means of online communication and publication (hereinafter “publication medium”).
      Readers’ data are processed for the purposes of the publication medium only to the extent necessary for its
      presentation and for communication between authors and readers or for security reasons. In addition, we refer to
      the information on the processing of visitors to our publication medium within the scope of this data protection
      notice.</p>



    <ol>
      <li><strong>Processed data types</strong>: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), contact data (e.g. e-mail,
        telephone numbers), content data (e.g. text entries, photographs, and videos), usage data (e.g. websites
        visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Persons concerned</strong>: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing</strong>: contractual services and performance, feedback (e.g. collecting
        feedback via online form).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Fulfilment of contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
        b. DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ol>



    <p><strong>Provision of the online offer and web hosting</strong></p>



    <p>In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting
      providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online services can be accessed. For these purposes
      we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well
      as security and technical maintenance services.</p>



    <p>The data processed within the scope of providing the hosting offer may include all data concerning the users of
      our online offer, which are generated within the scope of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP
      address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made
      within our online offer or from websites.</p>



    <p><strong>E-mail dispatch and hosting</strong></p>



    <p>The web hosting services we use also include the dispatch, receipt and storage of e-mails. For these purposes,
      the addresses of the recipients and senders as well as further information regarding the e-mail dispatch (e.g. the
      providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed.&nbsp;</p>



    <p>The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purpose of SPAM detection. Please note that e-mails on the
      Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit, but (unless a
      so-called end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can
      therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the e-mails between the sender and the
      reception on our server.</p>



    <p><strong>Collection of access data and log files</strong></p>



    <p>We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on every access to the server (so-called server log
      files). Server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, date and time of
      access, data volume transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user’s operating
      system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.</p>



    <p>The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the
      case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the capacity utilisation of the servers and their
      stability.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processed data types</strong>: Content data (e.g. text entries, photographs, and videos), usage data
        (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP
        addresses).</li>
      <li><strong>Persons concerned</strong>: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ul>



    <p><strong>Newsletter and Broadcasting</strong></p>



    <p>We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter “newsletters”) only with the consent
      of the recipients or a legal permission. If the contents of the newsletter are specifically described in the
      context of a registration for the newsletter, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Furthermore, our
      newsletters contain information about our services and us.</p>



    <p>In order to register for our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we
      may ask you to provide a name for the purpose of personal contact in the newsletter, or other details if these are
      necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.</p>



    <p><strong>Double opt-in procedure</strong></p>



    <p>The registration to our newsletter is always done in a so-called Double-Opt-In-Process. This means that after
      registration you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so
      that no one can register with foreign e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order
      to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the
      registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored by the shipping service
      provider are also logged.</p>



    <p><strong>Deletion and restriction of processing</strong></p>



    <p>We may store the deleted e-mail addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before
      deleting them in order to be able to prove that we have previously given our consent. The processing of this data
      is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at
      any time, provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In case of obligations to
      permanently observe contradictions, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a blacklist for this
      purpose alone.</p>



    <p>The logging of the registration procedure is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose
      of proving that it has been carried out properly. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is
      done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.</p>



    <p><strong>Information on legal bases</strong></p>



    <p>The dispatch of newsletters is based on the consent of the recipients or, if consent is not required, on our
      legitimate interests in direct marketing, if and to the extent permitted by law, e.g. in the case of advertising
      to existing customers. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our
      legitimate interests. The registration process is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests in order to
      prove that it was carried out in accordance with the law.</p>



    <p><strong>Measurement of success</strong></p>



    <p>The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when
      the newsletter is opened or, if we use a dispatch service provider, from their server. Within the scope of this
      retrieval, technical information such as information on the browser and your system, as well as your IP address
      and the time of the retrieval, is initially collected.</p>



    <p>This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter on the basis of the technical data or
      the target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval locations (which can be determined
      by means of the IP address) or the access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletter is
      opened, when it is opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to
      individual newsletter recipients.&nbsp;</p>



    <p>However, it is neither our endeavour nor, if used, that of the dispatch service provider to observe individual
      users. Rather, the evaluations serve to identify the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them
      or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>



    <p>The evaluation of the newsletter and the measurement of success are carried out, subject to the express consent
      of the users, on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a user-friendly and secure
      newsletter system that serves our business interests and meets the expectations of the users.</p>



    <p>A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in which case the entire
      newsletter subscription must be cancelled or objected to.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processed data types</strong>: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), contact data (e.g. e-mail,
        telephone numbers), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), usage data (e.g. websites
        visited, interest in content, access times).</li>
      <li><strong>Affected persons</strong>: communication partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing</strong>: direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or post).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6
        para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</li>
    </ul>



    <p><strong>Opt-out</strong></p>



    <p>You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke consent or object to further receipt. You
      will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter, or can use one of the contact
      options listed above, preferably e-mail.</p>



    <p><strong>Online marketing</strong></p>



    <p>We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include, in particular, the marketing of
      advertising space or the display of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as “Content”) based on
      the potential interests of users and the measurement of their effectiveness.</p>



    <p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called “cookie”) or similar
      procedures are used, by means of which the user information relevant for the presentation of the aforementioned
      content is stored. This information may include, for example, the content viewed, web pages visited, online
      networks used, but also communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, the computer
      system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this
      may also be processed.</p>



    <p>The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e.,
      pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the users. In general, the online marketing procedure
      does not store any clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names), but pseudonyms. This means that we as well
      as the providers of the online marketing procedures do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the
      information stored in their profiles.</p>



    <p>As a rule, the information in the profiles is stored in the cookies or by means of similar procedures. These
      cookies can later be read out and analysed for the purpose of presenting content on other websites that use the
      same online marketing procedure, and can also be supplemented with additional data and stored on the server of the
      online marketing procedure provider.</p>



    <p>As an exception, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are
      members of a social network whose online marketing procedure we use and the network connects the profiles of the
      users in the aforementioned data. Please note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g.
      by giving their consent during registration.</p>



    <p>As a matter of principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our
      advertisements. However, we can check in the context of so-called conversion measurements which of our online
      marketing procedures have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to the conclusion of a contract with
      us. The conversion measurement is used solely to analyse the success of our marketing measures.</p>



    <p>Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies used are stored for a period of two years.</p>



    <p><strong>Notes on legal bases</strong></p>



    <p>If we ask users to give their consent to the use of third parties, the legal basis for processing data is
      consent. Otherwise, the users’ data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in
      efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention
      to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><strong>Types of data processed</strong>: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access
        times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
      <li><strong>Affected persons</strong>: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services), interested
        parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing</strong>: Tracking (e.g. interest/behavioural profiling, use of cookies),
        remarketing, visitor action analysis, interest-based and behavioural marketing, profiling (creation of user
        profiles), conversion measurement (measurement of the effectiveness of marketing measures), reach measurement
        (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors).</li>
      <li><strong>Security measures</strong>: IP-Masking (pseudonymization of the IP address).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a DSGVO), legitimate interests (Art. 6

      off cookies in the settings of your browser. However, this may restrict the functions of our online offer. We

    <p><strong>Presence on social networks</strong></p>



    <p>We maintain online presences within social networks in order to communicate with the users active there or to
      offer information about us there.</p>



    <p>Please note that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This can result in risks for the users,
      because the enforcement of the users’ rights could be made more difficult. With regard to US providers that are
      certified under the Privacy Shield or offer comparable guarantees of a secure level of data protection, we would
      like to point out that they thereby undertake to comply with the data protection standards of the EU.</p>



    <p>Furthermore, user data within social networks is generally processed for market research and advertising
      purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the resulting interests of
      the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the
      networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored
      on the users’ computers, in which the usage behaviour and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data may
      also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are
      members of the respective platforms and are logged in to these).</p>



    <p>For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out),
      please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective
      networks.</p>



    <p>Additionally in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would like to
      point out that these can most effectively be asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to the
      data of the users and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. Should you nevertheless
      require assistance, please contact us.</p>

    <p><strong>Plugins and embedded functions and content</strong></p>



    <p>We include in our online offer functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their
      respective providers (hereinafter referred to as “third party providers”). These may be, for example, graphics,
      videos or social media buttons as well as contributions (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).</p>



    <p>The integration always requires that the third party providers of such content process the IP address of the
      users, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browsers. The IP address is
      therefore required for the display of these contents or functions. We make every effort to use only such content
      whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third party providers may also use
      so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes.
      Pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The
      pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may contain technical information
      about the browser and operating system, websites to be referred to, the time of visit and other details about the
      use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.</p>



    <p><strong>Notes on legal bases</strong></p>



    <p>If we ask users for their consent to use third party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent.
      Otherwise, the users’ data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient,
      economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the

    <p><strong>Rights of data subjects</strong></p>



    <p>As data subjects, they are entitled to various rights under the DSGVO, which result in particular from Art. 15 to
      18 and 21 DSGVO:</p>



    <ol>
      <li><strong>Right of objection</strong>: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your
        particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of
        Art. 6 paragraph 1 letter e or f FADP; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal
        data concerning you are processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time
        to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing, including profiling,
        insofar as it is linked to such direct marketing.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong>: You have the right to withdraw any consent given at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Right of access</strong>: You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether data in question is
        being processed and to obtain information on such data and to obtain further information and copies of the data
        in accordance with the law.</li>
      <li><strong>Right of rectification</strong>: You have the right to request the completion of data concerning you
        or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you in accordance with the law.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing</strong>: You have the right to request that data
        concerning you be erased immediately or, alternatively, to request a restriction of processing of the data in
        accordance with the law.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to data transferability</strong>: You have the right to receive data concerning you which you
        have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format in accordance with the legal
        requirements or to request that it be transferred to another responsible party.</li>
      <li><strong>Complaints to the supervisory authority</strong>: You also have the right, in accordance with the
        statutory provisions, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State in
        which you are normally resident, your place of work or the place where the infringement is alleged to have
        occurred, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you is in breach of the DPA.</li>
    </ol>



    <p><strong>Definitions of terms</strong></p>



    <p>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the
      law and defined above all in Art. 4 DSGVO. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the
      other hand, are primarily intended to help you understand them. The terms are sorted alphabetically.</p>



    <ol>
      <li><strong>Affiliate tracking</strong>: As part of affiliate tracking, links are logged with the help of which
        the linking websites refer users to websites with product or other offers. The operators of the respective
        linking websites can receive a commission if users follow these so-called affiliate links and then take
        advantage of the offers (e.g. buy goods or services). For this purpose, it is necessary for the providers to be
        able to track whether users who are interested in certain offers subsequently take notice of them at the
        instigation of the affiliate links. Therefore, for affiliate links to work, it is necessary to add certain
        values to them, which become part of the link or are stored elsewhere, e.g. in a cookie. These values include,
        in particular, the initial website (referrer), the time, an online identification of the operator of the website
        on which the affiliate link was located, an online identification of the respective offer, an online
        identification of the user as well as tracking specific values, such as advertising material ID, partner ID and
        categorizations.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion tracking</strong>: Conversion tracking is a method of determining the effectiveness of
        marketing activities. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the user’s devices within the websites on
        which the marketing measures are carried out and then retrieved again on the target website. For example, we can
        use this to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful).</li>
      <li><strong>IP-Masking</strong>: “IP-Masking” is a method in which the last octet, i.e. the last two numbers of an
        IP address, are deleted so that the IP address can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person. IP masking
        is therefore a means of pseudonymizing processing procedures, especially in online marketing</li>
      <li><strong>Interest-based and behavioral marketing</strong>: Interest-based and/or behavioral marketing is when
        potential interests of users in advertisements and other content are predetermined as precisely as possible.
        This is done on the basis of information about their previous behaviour (e.g. visiting and staying on certain
        websites, buying behaviour or interaction with other users), which is stored in a so-called profile. As a rule,
        cookies are used for these purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion measurement</strong>: Conversion measurement is a method by which the effectiveness of
        marketing measures can be determined. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the users’ devices within
        the websites on which the marketing measures are carried out and then retrieved again on the target website. For
        example, we can use this to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Data</strong>: “Personal Data” shall mean any information relating to an identified or
        identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as “Data Subject”); an identifiable natural person is one
        who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. a cookie) or one or more factors specific to
        the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li>
      <li><strong>Profiling</strong>: “profiling” is any automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
        personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending
        on the type of profiling, this may include information on age, gender, location and movement data, interaction
        with websites and their content, shopping behaviour, social interactions with other people). Cookies and web
        beacons are often used for profiling purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Reach measurement</strong>: Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the
        flow of visitors to an online offering and can include the behaviour or interests of visitors in certain
        information, such as the content of websites. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can, for example,
        identify at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them to
        better adapt the contents of the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies and web beacons
        are often used for reach analysis purposes in order to recognise returning visitors and thus obtain more precise
        analyses of the use of an online offering.</li>
      <li><strong>Remarketing</strong>: One speaks of “remarketing” or “retargeting”, e.g. when it is noted for
        advertising purposes in which products a user was interested on a website in order to remind the user of these
        products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements.</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking</strong>: One speaks of “tracking” if the behaviour of users can be traced across several
        online offers. As a rule, behavioral and interest information regarding the online offers used is stored in
        cookies or on servers of the providers of the tracking technologies (so-called profiling). This information can
        then be used, for example, to display advertisements to users that are likely to correspond to their interests.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Controller</strong>: The term “Controller” refers to the natural or legal person, authority,
        institution or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing
        personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Processing</strong>: “processing” shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed
        upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and covers virtually all processing of
        data, whether it be collection, analysis, storage, communication or deletion.</li>
